      Think about what we just proved and how we proved
      it. The em principle allowed us to consider two cases
      for each of P, Q, and R. In case any one of them is
      false, the an ease "or introduction" will prove the
      goal. In the case all of them are true, well, that
      contradicts the assumption, and (using false elim)
      we can ignore cases with contradictory assumptions
      because they can't actually happen.

    At this point there's nothing we can do *unless*
    we use excluded middle to consider only two cases,
    one where we have a proof that A is true and one 
    where we have a proof that it is not true. Then we
    do the same kind of case analysis for B. In effect
    we're *just looking at the truth table*. There are
    four cases: A true, B true; A true, A false; B true,
    A false; B false. Before proceeding, just think 
    about what happens in each case. Write out the

    Beyond just mechanically applying tactics,
    stop now and think about what you've got. As
    a mathematician, you want to start to "look
    ahead" to see "what will happen" if you try
    different approaches. Here, for example, you
    can see that if the disjunction is true because
    ¬ P is true, that will immediately give you a
    contradiction that you can use to be done with
    that case. Think ahead about the other case.
    Start to see beyond the current instant, to 
    see what's coming if you take certain paths.

    There's no way forward constructively.
    But if we can assume that there are only

      Right here you use another absolutely (!!)
      fundamental insight. If you have a proof
      of an implication and you have a proof of
      its premise you can derive a proof of its
      conclusion. In constructive logic this is
      done by "applying" the implication proof
      (a function!) to the premise proof (a valid
      argument).

  How to proceed here is a little tricky. A key
  insight is that you can apply em to whatever
  proposition you want, to get a proof that is is
  either true or a proof that it is false. Here,
  applying em to ¬ P does the trick. Think ahead
  to see if you can see why. Then *confirm* what
  you see by going through the proof script.

Note: Problems that start with ∃ are basically
search problems: you have to "searcg for, find,
and then use a witness that makes the proposition
true." In the worse case, use a truth table. That
is the way to systematically consider all possible
solutions. A problem with two "variables" will have
only four cases to consider. You can of course try
a value, and if you get stuck, "backtrack" (go back
and change your choice then try going forward again).
