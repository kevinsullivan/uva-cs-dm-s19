PART I: Functions. Functions are an essential
element of the language of predicate logic. In
this section, you show that you understand how
to define, use, and reason about functions in
Lean.

/- 1.

Study each of the following definitions,
then answer the associated question about 
the types involved in these definitions.

-- Consider this function
def f (n : ℕ) (s : string) := s

Define three functions called square,
square', and square'', each of type
ℕ to ℕ. Each function must return the
square of the value to which it is
applied. Write the first function in 
"C" style, the second using a tactic
script, and the third using a lambda
abstraction. Declare argument and return
types explicitly in each case.
-/

def square (n : ℕ) : ℕ := n^2

def square' (n : ℕ) : ℕ :=
begin
exact n^2
end

def square'' : ℕ → ℕ :=
    λ n : ℕ, n^2


/- 3. 

Construct three proofs to test your
function definitions. The first must
use "lemma" to define a proof, called 
square_3_9, of the proposition that 
(square 3) equals 9. The second must
use "theorem" to define a proof, called
square'_4_16, of the proposition that
square' applied to 4 reduces to 16. The
third must prove that square'' 5 is 
equal to 25. This third proof must not
use the equals sign, =, but must use 
"eq" instead to state the proposition
to be proved. Hint on #3, sometimes
you need to use parentheses to express
how you want terms to be grouped.
-/

lemma square_3_9 : square 3 = 9 := rfl
theorem square_4_16 : square' 4 = 16 := rfl
example : eq (square'' 5) 25 := rfl 


/- 4.
Define a function called last_first.
It takes two string values, called 
"first" and "last" (without quotes), 
as arguments, and it returns a string 
consisting of "last" followed by a
comma and a space followed by "first".
For example (first "Orson" "Welles").
Write a test case for your function to
prove that (last_first "Orson" "Welles")
is "Welles, Orson". Use "example", to
check the proof. Hint: The ++ operator
implements the string append function. 
-/

def last_first (first last : string) :=
    last ++ ", " ++ first

example: (last_first "Orson" "Welles") = "Welles, Orson" := rfl

Complete the following definition of a 
function, called apply3. It takes, as an
argument, a function, you might call it f,
of type ℕ → ℕ. It must return a function,
also of type ℕ to ℕ, that, when applied 
to a value, n, returns the result of 
applying the given function, f, to the 
given value, n, three times. That is, it
returns a function that computes f(f(f(n))). 
-/

def apply3 : (ℕ → ℕ) → (ℕ → ℕ) :=
    λ f : (ℕ → ℕ), 
        λ n, f (f (f n))

-- Just an extra sanity check, not required
#reduce apply3 (λ n, n^2) 2

/- 6.

The Lean libraries define a function, 
string.length, that takes a string and 
returns its length as a natural number. 
Define a function, len2, that takes two 
strings and returns the sum of their 
lengths. You may use the ++ operator
but not the + operator in your answer. 
Follow your function definition with a
test case in the form of a proof using
"example" showing that len2 applied to
"Orson" and "Welles" is 11.
-/

def len2 (s1 s2 : string) : ℕ := 
    string.length (s1 ++ s2)

example : len2 "Orson" "Welles" = 11 := rfl

/- 7.
Use "example" to prove that there is a 
function of the following type:

((ℕ → ℕ) → (ℕ → ℕ)) → 
    ((ℕ → ℕ) → ℕ) → 
        ((ℕ → ℕ) → ℕ)
-/

example : 
((ℕ → ℕ) → (ℕ → ℕ)) → 
    ((ℕ → ℕ) → ℕ) → 
        ((ℕ → ℕ) → ℕ) 
:= λ f g, g

PART II: Functions, revited. In 
mathematics,  functions play a central 
role. A function, f, in the mathematical 
sense is a triple, f = { D, P, C }, where 
D, a set, is the domain of definition of 
f, C is the co-domain of f, and P is a 
set of ordered pairs, each with a first 
element from D and a second element from
C,. In addition, P has one additional 
essential  property, the subject of one 
of the following questions.
-/

/- 8.

What one additional property is essential to 
the definition of what it means for a triple,
{ D, P, C } to be a function? 

Name the property. Answer: Single-Valued

Now explain precisely what it means:  "That there 
are no two pairs, (x, y) and (x', y') such that..." 

Fill in the blank, and use a logical ∧ in answering.
You might also want to use = or ≠.

Answer: x = x' ∧ y ≠ y'

The set of all values appearing as the first
element of any pair in P. 

Answer: domain

The set of all values appearing as the second
element of any pair in P. 

Answer: range

The property that the set of all values 
appearing as the first element of P is the
same as D. 

Answer: total

Answer: The property that the set of all 
values appearing as the first element of 
P is the same as C. 

Answer: surjective

The property of having both of the preceding
properties.

Answer: bijective

/- 10.

What does it mean for a function, f, to be 
injective? Give you answer by completing the 
following sentences with logical expressions.

"A function, f, is said to be injective if 
it has no two pairs, (x, y) and (x', y'), 
such that ..."

Answer: x ≠ x' ∧ y = y'

In other words, "If (x, y) and (x', y') are 
related by f and x ≠ x' then ..."

Answer: y ≠ y'

is defined to be a function, *in Lean*, of 
type S → T. Which of the following properties,
if any, does f necessarily have?

- N: bijective
- N: one-to-many
- N: one-to-one

to include total functions)

PART III: Logic and Proof.

/- 12a.

Use axiom and/or axioms in Lean to express,
in formal logic, the following assumptions:

- T is a type
- t1 and t2 are values of type T
- t1 = t2

Answer immediately after this comment block.
If you need to introduce a name, use eqt1t2.

axiom T : Type
axioms t1 t2 : T
axiom eqt1t2 : t1 = t2

Use axiom or axioms to represent the
additional assumptions that 

- P is a property of objects of type T
- t1 has property P

If you need to use a name, use Pt1

prove, that t2 also has property P.

values, a, b, and c of type ℕ, and that 
also takes proofs, cb : c = b, and 
ba : b = a, and that returns a proof 
that a = c.

the comma?

in the form indicate by a comment preceding 
the statement of the conjecture to be proved.
